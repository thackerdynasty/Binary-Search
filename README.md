# Binary Search
 A binary search package! Binary search is much more efficient at searching long lists than linear search.
##Usage
You can use all the code inside the `main.py` file for searching numerical lists. The only thing you need to change is the where the imports are, and the list in randlistsort. You may also need to reconfigure and add my main function into yours.
######Note: All files in the `.idea` folder are not needed for using the code. Not sure if you will need them if you import to intellij.
